# Sounds Directory

Place your sound files here for the timer notifications.

## Expected files:
- `start.mp3` - Sound played when timer starts
- `end.mp3` - Sound played when timer completes

## Sound recommendations:
- **start.mp3**: Short, ascending tone or positive "start" sound
- **end.mp3**: Clear notification sound, bell, or chime

You can use any sound file you like (MP3, WAV, etc.). Some suggestions:
- Pleasant notification sounds
- Short bell or chime sounds
- Custom sounds that fit your app's branding

If the files are not found, the system will fallback to generated beep sounds using Web Audio API.
